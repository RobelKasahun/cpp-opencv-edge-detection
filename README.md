Before running the project you must have a folder called build to store the build files
  3. make a directory named build                   
      cpp-opencv-edge-detection git:(main) ✗ mkdir build      

  4. Change the current directory to build
      cpp-opencv-edge-detection git:(main) ✗ cd build    

  5. Build your project     
      build git:(main) ✗ cmake ../
