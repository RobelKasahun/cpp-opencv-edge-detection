# cpp-opencv-edge-detection
This is a small and simple opencv edge detection project from video captured from the camera using C++ and OpenCV.

To run the project you must have the following tools
  1. Install homebrew if you do not have it in your system                      ---> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  2. Install opencv if you do not have it in your system using the command      ---> brew install opencv

Before running the project you must have a folder called build to store the build files
  3. cpp-opencv-edge-detection git:(main) ✗ mkdir build                         ---> make build directory
  4. cpp-opencv-edge-detection git:(main) ✗ cd build                            ---> change the directory to build
  5. build git:(main) ✗ cmake ../                                               ---> builds the project
  6. build git:(main) ✗ make                                                    ---> compiles your project using make command
  7. build git:(main) ✗ ./opencvproject                                         ---> runs your project
